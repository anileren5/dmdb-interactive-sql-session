    "### What is a Transaction?\n",
    "A transaction in SQL is a sequence of one or more SQL statements that are executed as a single unit of work. Transactions ensure that the database remains in a consistent state, even in the presence of failures or errors. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Are Transactions Important?\n",
    "Transactions are essential in database management systems because they:\n",
    "- Maintain **data integrity**.\n",
    "- Ensure **consistency** of the database.\n",
    "- Allow **safe concurrent access** by multiple users.\n",
    "- Enable recovery from unexpected failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### The ACID Properties\n",
    "Transactions are guided by four key properties collectively known as **ACID**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Atomicity**  \n",
    "   A transaction is all-or-nothing. If any part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction is rolled back, leaving the database unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Consistency**  \n",
    "   A transaction ensures that the database transitions from one valid state to another, maintaining the integrity of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Isolation**  \n",
    "    Transactions running concurrently operate as if they are the only ones executing in the system, ensuring they do not interfere with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Durability**  \n",
    "   Once a transaction is committed, the changes it made are permanent, even in the event of a system crash.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a bank transfer:  \n",
    "Alice wants to transfer \\$500 to Bob. The system must:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Deduct \\$500 from Alice's account.  \n",
    "2. Add \\$500 to Bob's account.  \n",
    "3. Ensure both steps succeed or neither happens (to avoid money disappearing or being created).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a perfect use case for transactions! "

    "\n",
    "In SQL, a **cursor** is a database object that allows you to interact with the result set of a query in a controlled, row-by-row manner. It provides a pointer to a specific row within the result set, allowing you to process the data incrementally.\n",
    "\n",

    "#### **Key Points of Cursors**:\n",

    "- **Purpose**: A cursor enables you to retrieve rows from the database one by one or in chunks, and perform operations like updating, inserting, or deleting specific rows as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **How it Works**:\n",
    "    - When you execute a query, the result set is generated by the database. \n",
    "    - The cursor helps navigate and interact with this result set.\n",
    "    - You can use the cursor to move through the data row by row or in batches.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Common Operations**:\n",
    "    - **Fetch Rows**: Cursors allow you to fetch one or more rows from the result set.\n",
    "    - **Iterate Over Rows**: You can iterate through the result set one row at a time, making it easy to process large sets of data incrementally.\n",

    "### Isolation Levels in SQL Transactions\n",
    "\n",
    "In database management systems (DBMS), **isolation levels** define the degree to which the operations in one transaction are isolated from those in other concurrent transactions. These levels determine how and when the changes made by one transaction become visible to other transactions.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Isolation Levels\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four standard isolation levels defined by the SQL standard, which can be set using the `SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL` statement. These levels control the visibility of data changes between concurrently running transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Read Uncommitted**\n",

    "3. **Repeatable Read**\n",
    "4. **Serializable**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Read Uncommitted**\n",
    "- **Description**: In this isolation level, transactions can read data that has been modified but not yet committed by other transactions. This is known as a **dirty read**.\n",
    "- **Use case**: This level is rarely used in practice because it can lead to data inconsistency. However, it might be acceptable when performance is more critical than correctness.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  **Example**: \n",
    "  - Transaction A updates a record but has not yet committed it.\n",
    "  - Transaction B reads that uncommitted data (a **dirty read**).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Anomalies**: \n",
    "  - **Dirty Reads**: A transaction reads uncommitted changes from another transaction.\n",
    "  - **Non-repeatable Reads**: Data read by one transaction is modified by another before the first transaction completes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Read Committed**\n",
    "- **Description**: In this isolation level, a transaction can only read data that has been **committed** by other transactions. This avoids dirty reads but allows non-repeatable reads.\n",
    "- **Use case**: This is the default isolation level for many database systems because it strikes a good balance between data consistency and performance.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  **Example**: \n",
    "  - Transaction A commits an update.\n",
    "  - Transaction B can read the committed data.\n",

    "  - **Non-repeatable Reads**: A transaction reads a value, and another transaction modifies that value before the first transaction completes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Repeatable Read**\n",
    "- **Description**: In this isolation level, transactions can only see data that was committed before the transaction started, and once a value is read, it will not change during the transaction's duration. This prevents **dirty reads** and **non-repeatable reads**.\n",
    "- **Use case**: This level is used when data consistency is critical, and there is a need to ensure that a value read at one point in time cannot change during the transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Example**: \n",
    "  - Transaction A reads data and locks it.\n",
    "  - Transaction B cannot modify that data until Transaction A completes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Anomalies**: \n",
    "  - **Phantom Reads**: New rows can be added or removed by other transactions, which would not be visible to the current transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Serializable**\n",
    "- **Description**: This is the highest level of isolation. It ensures that transactions are executed in such a way that their effect is as if they were run **serially**, one after the other. This eliminates **dirty reads**, **non-repeatable reads**, and **phantom reads**.\n",
    "- **Use case**: Use this level when data consistency is paramount and the workload can tolerate reduced performance due to strict isolation requirements.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  **Example**: \n",
    "  - Transaction A runs, locks the data, and no other transaction can interfere until it completes.\n",
    "  - Transaction B cannot access any data that might affect Transaction A’s result until A finishes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Anomalies**: \n",
