    "# SQL III - View\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "### What is a View?\n",
    "A view is a reusable virtual table that is created by querying existing tables. The virtual table is not saved in memory. Instead, the query used for the view is saved with the name. Each time the view is used, a new query of that view is being executed. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Are Views Important?\n",
    "- **Privacy**: views can limit the information shared by taking a subset of information from full tables\n",
    "- **Reusability**: can make repetitive queries easier to write\n",
    "- **Generalization**: can combine different sub categories into a larger category\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Normal Views vs Materialized Views\n",
    "While normal views do not store the result of a query, materialized views store the results of a query into memory. This has the benefit of increasing the speed of data retrieval but at the cost of memory space and overhead from maintaining data consistency. "
