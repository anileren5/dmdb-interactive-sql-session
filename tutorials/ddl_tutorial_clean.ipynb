    "\n",
    "- **How it Works**:\n",
    "    - When you execute a query, the result set is generated by the database. \n",
    "    - The cursor helps navigate and interact with this result set.\n",
    "    - You can use the cursor to move through the data row by row or in batches.\n",

    "- **Common Operations**:\n",
    "    - **Fetch Rows**: Cursors allow you to fetch one or more rows from the result set.\n",
    "    - **Iterate Over Rows**: You can iterate through the result set one row at a time, making it easy to process large sets of data incrementally.\n",
    "    - **Modify Data**: Cursors can be used to update, delete, or insert rows in a transaction.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Numeric**\n",
    "* Integers: they come in different sizes from `TINYINT` (1 Bytes), `SMALLINT` (2 Bytes), `MEDIUMINT` (3 Bytes), `INT` (4 Bytes), to `BIGINT` (8 Bytes)\n",
    "* Floating Point: should be familier from other programming languages, namely `FLOAT` and `DOUBLE`\n",
    "* Fixed point: unlike floating point numbers, the number of digits to the left and right of the point is fixed in data type `DECIMAL(M,D)`. This is a parameterised data type where `M` is the total number of digits and `D` the number of digits after the decimal point.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will sometimes also see data types like `INT` parameterised as `INT(11)`. The number here indicates the number of digits that are displayed back to the user when querying the data, but does not affect the range of values that can be stored. Moreover we can also add the `UNSIGNED` keyword after to ensure the numbers are positive\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strings**\n",
    "* `CHAR(M)`: stores `M` characters. If fewer than `M` characters are provided, the string will be padded and if more are provided the string will be truncated\n",
    "* `VARCHAR(M)`: stores any number of characters up to `M`. If more characters are inserted, the string will be truncated.\n",
    "* `BLOB/TEXT`: used to store *large* data. `BLOB` stores binary data, whereas `TEXT` is used to store large strings\n",
    "* `ENUM('A','B','C')`: just like in other programming languages, this allows the storage of only a set number of different strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Date & Time**\n",
    "* `DATE`: stores a date in 'YYYY-MM-DD'\n",
    "* `DATETIME`: stores a date together with a time on that day in 'YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss'\n",
    "* `TIMESTAMP`: stores the time as the number of seconds since January 1st 1970\n",
    "\n",
    "**Others**\n",
    "* JSON\n",
    "* Spatial Data\n",
    "\n",

    "* `NOT NULL`: used to disallow NULLs in a column\n",
    "* `FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES table_name(col)`: ensures that values in this column match a column in another table\n",
